🌟 About Me

I’m an AI Engineer passionate about building intelligent, autonomous AI systems that combine
LLMs + Agents + RAG + Automation to solve real-world problems.

After 9+ years in engineering, I transitioned into the AI domain and now focus on:

🧠 LLMs (GPT, Gemini, HF Models)

🤖 Agentic AI & Multi-Agent Systems

🔍 RAG Pipelines (FAISS, Embeddings, Vector DBs)

📘 Deep Learning & NLP

➿ Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning, Policy Gradients)

⚙️ AI Automation & Tool-Use Systems

Currently pursuing M.Tech in AI, specializing in enterprise-grade AI agents capable of reasoning, planning, tool usage, and autonomous execution.
